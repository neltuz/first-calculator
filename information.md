## Variables ##
variables are ways to store information in memory. It can be defined by let, const or var.
Let's focus on only "let" for now

Example
```js
let x = 300;
//here x is a variable.

const y = 50;
//const is constant. you cannot change or overwrite the value again.
y=30 // this will give error because we defined y as const (constant)
```


## Statements ##
Statement are instructions that you give to a computer.

Example
```js
/*
here is an instruction for adding two values and store in a variable called answer. In JavaScript statements usually ends with semi-colon
*/
let answer = 2 + 7;
```

## Comments ##
Comments are description you put in a code for other developers to understand your code or yourself to remember. It does nothing to you program.

In Javascript,
Single line of comment starts with this //
Multiple lines of comment can be started with this /* and end with this */

Examples
```js
// I am a single line comment

// I am another single line of comment

/*  I am a multiple
    line of comments.
    I can describe more things
*/

```
